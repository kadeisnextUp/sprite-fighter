# Sprite fighting game

A sprite fighter game that I am developing purely out of passion.
The characters I am using so far are Shadow (Sonic the Hedgehog) and Trunks (Dragon Ball Z).
The game is fully developed in Python using PyGame.

# Game is finished, executable is coming soon.

# I will be remaking this game using Godot, as there were many issues in developing this game in Python. More characters and features will be added to the Godot version.
